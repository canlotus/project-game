# Card Match Game Prototype

## Overview

This project is a functional prototype of a card-match game, developed to demonstrate core gameplay mechanics, including card flipping, matching, and basic animations. The game is built using Unity 2021 LTS and follows the guidelines provided in the project specification.

## Gameplay Features

- **Card Flipping:** Players can flip the cards to reveal their faces. The cards flip back if they do not match.
- **Continuous Card Interaction:** The system allows continuous card flipping without requiring users to wait for card comparisons to finish before selecting additional cards.
- **Various Layouts:** The game supports different card layouts, such as 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, etc. Cards are scaled to fit the display area dynamically.
- **Scoring System:** Players earn points for each correct match. The score is displayed and updated in real-time.
- **Sound Effects:** Includes sound effects for card flipping, matching, mismatching, and game over.
- **Save/Load System:** The game saves the player's progress, allowing them to continue from where they left off after restarting the game.
- **Animations:** Smooth animations for card flipping and matching are implemented to enhance the user experience.

## Requirements

- **Unity 2021 LTS** or higher is required to run the project.
- The game can be run on both desktop and mobile platforms (Android or iOS).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

How to Play
Choose a Layout: Select the desired card layout from the menu.
Flip Cards: Click on cards to flip them over. Try to find matching pairs.
Match Pairs: When two cards match, they will stay flipped. If they do not match, they will flip back.
Score Points: Earn points for each pair of matching cards. The game ends when all pairs are matched.
